# immune-profiling

## Repository to house scripts, presentations, and workflows related to the immunological profiling team in the Antibody Engineers Hackathon 2023

### Contents

#### Presentations:
  - link to our google drive progress and final presentations

#### Scripts
  - jupyter notebooks and other affiliated scripts created during the hackathon

#### Datasets

#### What we learned, goals for future
1. Immunoprofiling data are excellent for teaching bioinformatics, raw data needs to be processed and aligend to reference data: teaches workflow and scripting commands concepts. The output, very large tables, require programs to view and analyze data: teaches data science and statistics concepts (what do various plots mean). Working with real life data has purpose, some data are deposited but not published. Curated data have new questions that can be asked. 
3. Be able to accomidate beginning programmers - table manipulations, run programs
4. Individuals with more experiece can help with infrastructure and workflows for larger data processing activities.
5. Prehackathon, in addition to preparing instances for computing, set up exercises, with small datasets, in Google CoLab. Encourage new programmers to try those. Connect google sheets (small datasets) to pandas to help new programmers understand the data.
6. Work toward scaling projects to incorporate database concepts and machine learning.
